## Setup for new Hugo users:

1. In terminal/command line, setup your website folder in Hugo as you like :

		hugo new site MyWebsiteFolder
	
2. Place **bubblegasket** folder and its contents in MyWebsiteFolder/themes/

		git clone https://github.com/danieljudd/bubblegasket.git

3. Add line **theme = 'bubblegasket'** to root file (MyWebsiteFolder/config.toml) or copy config below

## Configuration example (and config.toml)
### Website requires you to create your own 'content' folders under *yoursite.com* /content/EXAMPLEFOLDER
**...use any appropriate name and assign them under the config.toml**
**These will then appear under your website's navigation and point to your created folder.**

	baseURL = 'https://example.org/'
	languageCode = 'en-us'
	title = "BubbleGasket"
	theme = 'bubblegasket'

	# (menu) titles would end with "s" otherwise
	pluralizeListTitles = false
	Copyright = '¬©'

	[params]
		Email = 'example@example.com'
		Footer = 'example.com'
		Github = 'https://github.com/github'
		# Turn on or off tag cloud (true is on or false off)
		Tags = false
		# Turn on or off archive (true is on or false off)
		Archive = false
		# Emoji icons: https://emojipedia.org
		Icon = '‚òÇÔ∏è'
		numPosts = '3'
		Section1 = "blog"
		Section2 = "work"
	[menu]
		[[menu.main]]
			name = "‚òï About"
			url = "/about"
			weight = 1
		[[menu.main]]
			name = "‚úíÔ∏è Blog"
			url = "/blog"
			weight = 2
		[[menu.main]]
			name = "üëî Work"
			url = "/work"
			weight = 3
		[[menu.main]]
			name = "üì≠ Donate"
			url = "/donate"
			weight = 4
		

1. Create hugo posts and (optionally) use tags
		hugo new blog/mypost.md
		
For tags (Tags = true), edit the file and add this line in header of mypost.md:

		tags = [changeme,topic,blog,category,etc]

2. Customize CSS options by searching for keywords "color" and "font-size" and "font-family"
